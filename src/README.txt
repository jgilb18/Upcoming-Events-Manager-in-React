ABOUT THE PROJECT:

I built this project in order to gain a better understanding of React. Prior to this project, I had
created very simple programs using React, but this was the first larger project that I've done. Working
through this project has greatly improved my knowledge of useState, event handlers, passing through props,
and understanding how to create a logic flow for a larger kind of project.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:

This project was designed as an app where a user can add, edit, and remove upcoming events. 
When the user starts the app, a webpage opens with two sample events. The user can then edit events,
delete events, or create new events. The list of events displays on the left side of the screen.

Editing Events:
To edit an event, the user should click on the "Edit" button at the top right of the event that they
want to change. From there, a copy of that event's information will pop up on the right side of the screen. 
However, the user is able to update any fields on the right side to any values that they want. In addition, the
user has the freedom to add or remove attendees.

Deleting Events:
If a user wants to delete an event, they can simply click on the "Delete" button at the top right of 
the event. The event will be removed from the list and will then be unretrievable.

Creating Events:
To create an event, the user can click "Create Event" at the bottom of events list. This will create
a template for a new event, which the user can then edit in order to add the information for their new event.
